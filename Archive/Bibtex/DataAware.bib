abstract = {Existing container based serverless computing systems are limited by cold-start problems and complex architecture for stateful services, multi-tenancy, etc. This paper presents serverless functions to be placed as per data locality and executed as a web-assembly sandbox, which results better execution latency and reduced network usage as compared to the existing architectures. The designed serverless runtime features resource isolation in terms of CPU, Memory, and file-system isolation and falicitates multi-tenancy executions. The proposed architecture is evaluated using IoT workloads with different performance metrics.},
