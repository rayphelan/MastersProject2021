abstract = {We present twenty-five C programs, as a benchmark for C program verification using formal methods. This benchmark can be used for system demonstration, for comparison of verification effort between systems, and as a friendly competition. For this last purpose, we give a scoring formula that allows a verification system to score up to a hundred points.},
