abstract = {Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is observed in various applications, i.e., scheduling problems, timetabling problems, assignment problems, etc. Researchers adopt a CSP technique to tackle a certain problem; however, each technique follows different approaches and ways to solve a problem network. In this exhaustive study, it has been possible to visualize the processes of essential CSP algorithms from a very concrete constraint satisfaction example, N-Queens Problem, in order to possess a deep understanding about how a particular constraint satisfaction problem will be dealt with by the studied and implemented techniques. Besides, benchmark results - time vs. value of N in N-Queens - have been generated from the implemented approaches, which help understand at what factor each algorithm produces solutions; especially, in N-Queens puzzle. Thus, extended decisions can be made to instantiate a real life problem within CSP's framework.},
