abstract = {Sorting is a technique to rearrange a given list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. There are a large number of Sorting Algorithms like Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bucket Sort, Shell Sort, etc. The efficiency of the sorting algorithm depends on many factors such as memory usage patterns (the number of times the sections of memory must be copied or swapped to and from the disk), the total number of comparisons and the time requirements for the algorithms to run. In this paper, a method is proposed which combines two sorting algorithms (Bucket Sort and Shell Sort) in a way that takes advantage of the strength of each to improve overall performance.},
