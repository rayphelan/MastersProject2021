abstract = {The N-Queens problem has been studied for over a century. The N-Queens problem may be solved using a variety of methods including backtracking algorithms and mathematical equations such as magic squares. We propose a more efficient approach to the most used technique, backtracking, by removing the threatened cells in order to decrease the number of trial and error steps.},
