abstract = {This paper considers how WASM can be run in different serverless contexts. A comparison of different serverside WASM runtime options is considered, specifically focused on wasmer, wasmtime and lucet. Next, different options for running WASM within two serverless platforms – Openwhisk and AWS Lambdai – are compared. Initial results show that a solution which uses the built-in node.js WASM supports is found to work better than using the dedicated WASM runtimes but this has limitations and providing more direct integration with WASM runtimes should be explored further.},
