abstract = {The N queens problem is a very hot topic for research use. Nonetheless all previous algorithms that solved the N queens problem treat each order of it as if they are separate problems with no connection among them. The main idea of this paper is to connect the dots among various orders of the N queens problem and demonstrate that all orders of the N-queens problem are connected with each other. And then we propose an algorithm using iterative compression to solve the problem i.e., beginning from the solution of the least order of the problem and then by using the relation among different orders we add a queen in every iteration until we have the N queens residing in the NxN board.},
