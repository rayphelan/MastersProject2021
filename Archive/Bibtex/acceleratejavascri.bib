	abstract = {Although the performance of today’s {JavaScript} engines is sufficient for most web applications, faster and more predictable runtimes could be desired for performance-critical web code. Therefore, we present Speedy.js, a cross-compiler that translates {JavaScript}/{TypeScript} to {WebAssembly}, a new standard for native execution supported by all major browsers. Speedy.js only imposes minimal restrictions on the {JavaScript} code, namely that the performance-critical functions are wrapped in {TypeScript} and only engage a performance-optimal subset of the {JavaScript} language. With this approach, we manage to make compute-intense web code up to four times faster, while reducing runtime fluctuations to the half.},
