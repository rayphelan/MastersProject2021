	abstract = {Recent advances in execution environments for {JavaScript} and {WebAssembly} that run on a broad range of devices, from workstations and mobile phones to {IoT} devices, provide new opportunities for portable and web-based numerical computing. Indeed, numerous numerical libraries and applications are emerging on the web, including Tensorflow.js, {JSMapReduce}, and the {NLG} Protein Viewer. This paper evaluates the current performance of numerical computing on the web, including both {JavaScript} and {WebAssembly}, over a wide range of devices from workstations to {IoT} devices. We developed a new benchmarking approach, which allowed us to perform centralized benchmarking, including benchmarking on mobile and {IoT} devices. Using this approach we performed four performance studies using the Ostrich benchmark suite, a collection of numerical programs representing the numerical dwarf categories identified by Colella. We studied the performance evolution of {JavaScript}, the relative performance of {WebAssembly}, the performance of server-side Node.js, and a comprehensive performance showdown for a wide range of devices.},
