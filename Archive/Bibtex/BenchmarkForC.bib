	title = {A benchmark for C program veriﬁcation},
	abstract = {We present twenty-ﬁve C programs, as a benchmark for C program veriﬁcation using formal methods. This benchmark can be used for system demonstration, for comparison of veriﬁcation eﬀort between systems, and as a friendly competition. For this last purpose, we give a scoring formula that allows a veriﬁcation system to score up to a hundred points.},
