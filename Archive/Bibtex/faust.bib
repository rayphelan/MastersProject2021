abstract = {\beginabstract This paper demonstrates how FAUST, a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing, can be used to develop efficient audio code for the Web. After a brief overview of the language, its compiler and the architecture system allowing to deploy the same program as a variety of targets, the generation of WebAssembly code and the deployment of specialized WebAudio nodes will be explained. Several use cases will be presented. Extensive benchmarks to compare the performance of native and WebAssembly versions of the same set of DSP have be done and will be commented. \endabstract.},
