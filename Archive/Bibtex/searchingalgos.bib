abstract = {There are many search algorithms that can be applied to a set of data. Mostly commonly known and used among them are binary search and linear search. While linear search compares every element of the array with the element to be searched, binary search divides the array into sections and compares the middle element of each section with the key element to be searched. Now, while each algorithm is useful and effective in its own way, each one has its own problem. In binary search, the data needs to be sorted in some order, while in linear search, every element is visited and compared with key element sequentially, and hence takes a lot of time. This paper provides an entirely new algorithm which combines the advantages of both the algorithms and provides an effective way to search for a given key element in an unsorted array, in limited time.},
