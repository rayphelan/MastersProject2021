abstract = {Recent advances in execution environments for JavaScript and WebAssembly that run on a broad range of devices, from workstations and mobile phones to IoT devices, provide new opportunities for portable and web-based numerical computing. Indeed, numerous numerical libraries and applications are emerging on the web, including Tensorflow.js, JSMapReduce, and the NLG Protein Viewer. This paper evaluates the current performance of numerical computing on the web, including both JavaScript and WebAssembly, over a wide range of devices from workstations to IoT devices. We developed a new benchmarking approach, which allowed us to perform centralized benchmarking, including benchmarking on mobile and IoT devices. Using this approach we performed four performance studies using the Ostrich benchmark suite, a collection of numerical programs representing the numerical dwarf categories identified by Colella. We studied the performance evolution of JavaScript, the relative performance of WebAssembly, the performance of server-side Node.js, and a comprehensive performance showdown for a wide range of devices.},
